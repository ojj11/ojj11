Hello, I'm Olli (he/him). During the day I help build the [Microsoft SwiftKey Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey). This has included [supporting the proposal of the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è emoji](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19080-transgender-flag.pdf); [filing a patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10185701B2/en?oq=US10185701B2); and [helping reduce our app size](https://medium.com/microsoft-mobile-engineering/app-size-reduction-at-microsoft-swiftkey-f77d7d5916b); amongst other things. You'll find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ollijones).

Outside of work, I publish JavaScript libraries on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~ojj11), and very, very occassionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/1290nowarchived).
